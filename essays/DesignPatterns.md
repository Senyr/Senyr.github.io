In my coding experiences, I envision each project as a musical piece, where every part harmonizes to create a beautiful composition. Design patterns, in this analogy, are akin to musical notes and arrangements that guide me in creating software that's not just functional but also fashionable. It's as if the code I create is a symphony, and these design patterns are the melodies ensuring everything fits together smoothly.

## What are Design Patterns?: Coded Melodies

Design patterns, act like well-known solutions in coding that have been proven to be efficent for a long period of time, much like using familiar tunes or musical themes in songs. An example is the singleton pattern, which organizes code to ensure there's only one instance of something, similar to a specific melody repeating throughout a song. Using these patterns feels like relying on trusted methods that I know work well, creating clear and efficient code.

## How I Use Them in My Code: Guidiing Harmony

In my coding experiences, especially in my final project for ICS 314, design patterns have been my trusted guidelines. I employed the Observer pattern implicitly through the 'useTracker' hook, acting as a potent part in my code symphony. In the project, I applied it to make different parts work in unison, much like instruments syncing up with a conductor, ensuring all pieces work together smoothly. As a developer, this experience showed me how using these patterns makes code strong and efficient. It's like having a set of reliable tools in your toolbox for building things that work really well.

Another pattern at my disposal is the Bridge pattern, connecting the form schema with the form library in one of my components. It's like creating a coherent link between different musical sections, ensuring the harmony of data exchange. This pattern, much like a musical bridge uniting two melodies, facilitated a smooth interaction between the form structure and the rendering library, enhancing the overall composition of my coding symphony. Its influence wasn't just helpful in the current project; it also adds for future improvements. This highlights how picking the right design patterns can be essential in your box of tools.

## The Grand Finale

In the final stage of creating my software, the significance of design patterns becomes clearer. They're not just abstract concepts; they act like musical notations transforming my code into a well-structured composition. Through patterns like Observer and Bridge, I've crafted a system that works in unison effectively. As a developer, I see myself as the composer of my digital creations, and design patterns are like my musical notes. They help me craft software that's intricate yet easy to understand, adding a touch of classiness. So, when an interviewer brings up design patterns, I can showcase the musical journey that is my code.
