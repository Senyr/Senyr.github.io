## JavaScript: Coding Standards

When it comes to the coding standards everyone has their opinion. The question to be asked does coding standards really help us code? In my persoanl opinion I believe the coding standards doesnt help with the functionality of the code and more of making the code look easily presentable. It is very important to have code that is easily readable for many factoes.For example if there was a certain bug/error you have to fix and your code looks messy it would be alot harder for you or any other person to help and debug the problem. Making the code neat is like decorating a food plate at a restaraunt, even though the food might taste good you still want the people eating eating the food to enjoy the presenation of it as well, people would like to enjoy a meal thats amazing even before it reaches their mouths
